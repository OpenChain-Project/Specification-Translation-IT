the
openchain
initiative
began
in
2013
when
a
group
of
software
supply
chain
open
source
practitioners
observed
two
emerging
patterns
1
significant
process
similarities
existed
among
organizations
with
mature
open
source
compliance
programs
and
2
there
still
remained
a
large
number
of
organizations
exchanging
software
with
less
developed
programs
the
latter
observation
resulted
in
a
lack
of
trust
in
the
consistency
and
quality
of
the
compliance
artifacts
accompanying
the
software
being
exchanged
as
a
consequence
at
each
tier
of
the
supply
chain
downstream
organizations
were
frequently
redoing
the
compliance
work
already
performed
by
other
upstream
organizations

a
study
group
was
formed
to
consider
whether
a
standard
program
specification
could
be
created
that
would
i
facilitate
greater
quality
and
consistency
of
open
source
compliance
information
being
shared
across
the
industry
and
ii
decrease
the
high
transaction
costs
associated
with
open
source
resulting
from
compliance
rework
the
study
group
evolved
into
a
work
group
and
in
april
2016
formally
organized
as
a
linux
foundation
collaborative
project

the
vision
and
mission
of
the
openchain
initiative
are
as
follows




vision
a
software
supply
chain
where
freeopen
source




software
foss
is
delivered
with
trustworthy
and
consistent




compliance
information




mission
establish
requirements
to
achieve
effective
management




of
freeopen
source
software
foss
for
software
supply
chain




participants
such
that
the
requirements
and
associated
collateral




are
developed
collaboratively
and
openly
by
representatives
from
the




software
supply
chain
open
source
community
and
academia

in
accordance
with
the
vision
and
mission
this
specification
defines
a
set
of
requirements
that
if
met
would
significantly
increases
the
probability
that
an
open
source
compliance
program
had
achieved
a
sufficient
level
of
quality
consistency
and
completeness
although
a
program
that
satisfies
all
the
specification
requirements
does
not
guarantee
full
compliance
the
requirements
represent
a
base
level
minimum
set
of
requirements
a
program
must
satisfy
to
be
considered
openchain
conforming
the
specification
focuses
on
the
“what”
and
“why”
qualities
of
a
compliance
program
as
opposed
to
the
“how”
and
“when”
considerations
this
ensures
a
practical
level
of
flexibility
that
enables
different
organizations
to
tailor
their
policies
and
processes
to
best
fit
their
objectives

section
2
introduces
definitions
of
key
terms
used
throughout
the
specification
section
3
presents
the
specification
requirements
where
each
one
has
a
list
of
one
or
more
verification
artifacts
they
represent
the
evidence
that
must
exist
in
order
for
a
given
requirement
to
be
considered
satisfied
if
all
the
requirements
have
been
met
for
a
given
program
it
would
be
considered
openchain
conforming
in
accordance
with
version

the
